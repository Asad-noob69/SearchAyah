Imam Muslim applied rigorous criteria to verify the reliability of narrators and the continuity of the chain of transmission, which is why the Hadiths in this collection are highly regarded. Sahih Muslim consists of approximately 3,033 unique Hadiths, arranged by topics such as faith, prayer, charity, fasting, pilgrimage, and legal matters. Unlike other collections, Imam Muslim includes multiple chains of transmission for the same Hadith, highlighting the authenticity of the reports. This compilation serves as a key source for Islamic jurisprudence and is a primary reference for scholars and students.

Often translated as The Introduction, this work serves as a preface to Ibn Khaldun's larger historical narrative, providing profound insights into the nature of society, the dynamics of civilizations, and the processes of social change. Ibn Khaldun introduces his innovative concepts, such as 'Asabiyyah (social cohesion or group solidarity) and the cyclical theory of history, which explains how societies rise, flourish, and eventually decline. He argues that strong social bonds and collective identity are essential for the prosperity of any civilization, while the weakening of these bonds leads to its downfall."
